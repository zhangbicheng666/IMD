# Flutter

## 1. What is Flutter

Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google and released in May 2017. In a few words, it allows you to create a native mobile application with only one codebase. This means that you can use one programming language and one codebase to create two different apps (for iOS and Android).

Flutter consists of two important parts:

- An SDK (Software Development Kit): A collection of tools that are going to help you develop your applications. This includes tools to compile your code into native machine code (code for iOS and Android).
- A Framework (UI Library based on widgets): A collection of reusable UI elements (buttons, text inputs, sliders, and so on) that you can personalize for your own needs.

Flutter combines ease of development with performance similar to native performance while maintaining visual consistency between platforms. Flutter’s programming language, Dart, was initially intended as a replacement for JavaScript. If you know a bit of programming, Dart is a typed object programming language. You can compare Dart's syntax to JavaScript.

## 2. How Flutter Works

The framework of Flutter, written in the Dart programming language, has the Flutter engine, Foundation library, and widgets. The approach to development in Flutter differs from others by its declarative UI writing. Here, there is a need to start from the end, meaning before starting the development of some element, the user needs to have in mind a complete picture of what kind of UI it will be. Many developers distinguish this UI writing as a more clear one, but it also causes certain difficulties for developers at first.

The main idea of Flutter is that developers can build the entire user interface by simply combining different widgets. The application interface consists of various nested widgets, which can be any object. This applies to anything from buttons to padding, and by combining widgets, the developer can customize the application radically. Widgets can influence each other and use built-in functions to respond to external changes in the state. Widgets are important elements of the user interface and comply with the design specifications of Android, iOS and conventional web applications. 

## 3. Who Use Flutter

Although Flutter is young enough, it is already used by such global services as Google Ads, Alibaba, AppTree, Reflectly [and many others.](https://flutter.dev/showcase)

## 4. PROS of Flutter

### ① Good documentation & Simple to learn and use

It’s important for new technology to have good documentation. But it’s not always the case that it has it!

Developers can learn a lot from [Flutter's documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), and everything is very detailed with easy examples for basic use cases. 

### ② A growing community

Flutter has a robust community, and it’s only the beginning.

- [Flutter Awesome:](https://flutterawesome.com/) An awesome list that curates the best Flutter libraries and tools. This website publishes daily content with lots of examples, application templates, advice, and so on.
- [Awesome Flutter:](https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter) A GitHub repository (linked to Flutter Awesome) with a list of articles, videos, components, utilities, and so on.
- [It’s all widgets!:](https://itsallwidgets.com/) An open list of apps built with Flutter.
- [Flutter Community:](https://medium.com/flutter-community) A Medium publication where you can find articles, tutorials, and much more.

### ③ Quick code development 

Flutter creators wanted to invent a technology with the quickest opportunity to deliver a great-performing, cross-platform mobile application. The following features allow this:

 - **Hot reload**

   Developers can make changes to the codebase on-the-fly, and see them immediately reflected in the application. This is the so-called [Hot reload](https://flutter.io/hot-reload/) feature, and it typically takes (milli-)seconds for changes to show.

 - **Widgets**

   One of the most significant benefits of Flutter is how it uses ready-made widgets. This ensures that Flutter offers a consistent model for development and design. Widgets are Google-based, so they are high code quality and perform better than other open-source frameworks. As most of them are extremely customizable, they save developers’ time like no other framework. In addition to the major layout widgets, Flutter widgets follow both the Material and Cupertino looks, which is a huge advantage.

 - **Minimal code and access to native features**

   Flutter lets developers use Dart, which is compiled directly into the ARM code of mobile devices and helps not only to speed up applications, it allows them to launch quicker also.

- **One codebase, 2 mobile platforms (and more!)**

### ④ Great UI

- **Beautiful, custom design**

  Flutter allows users to develop applications with custom designs, which will look equally good on iOS and Android devices.

- **Same business logic and UI**

  Possible for Flutter sharing the UI and business logic on Android and Apple devices allow developers to achieve a seamless experience regardless of the OS. This is primarily important for brands with a unique and outstanding corporate style.

- **UI customization potential**

  A huge advantage of Flutter is the ability to customize everything you see on screen, regardless of the complexity of the element. The amount of effort required is fundamentally lower from that required on native platforms’ development software.

## 5. CONS of Flutter

### ① Libraries & support – impressive, but still not as rich as native development

Google’s support for Flutter is impressive, but Flutter is still quite new. This means you can’t always find the functionality you need in existing libraries, so your developers might need to build custom functionality themselves, which takes time.

### ② Large file size

Applications written in Flutter are bigger than native ones. Check out the article Comparing APK sizes. However, the Flutter team is working on reducing the size of apps made with Flutter.

### ③ New skills required

While Flutter is easy to use and can be learned by non-programmers, it does require developers to learn Dart first. This adds an additional phase of learning, which can increase the time and money for any project. That being said,if a developer knows Java/C#, he or she can easily upskill to Dart. Moreover, Flutter’s Dart programming language is pretty easy to learn for those with little programming experience.
